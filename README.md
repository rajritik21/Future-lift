*Note: This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the UI/UX design principles, front-end development approach, and component architecture implemented in the FutureLift Job Portal. The design system and components are built with scalability and maintainability in mind.*

## Chapter 5: Back-End Development

### 5.1 Database Design

The FutureLift Job Portal employs MongoDB as its primary database system, chosen for its flexibility, scalability, and excellent performance with JSON-like documents. The database design follows a well-structured schema that efficiently handles the complex relationships between different entities in the system.

#### 5.1.1 Core Database Schema

The database schema is designed with careful consideration of data relationships, query patterns, and scalability requirements. The primary collections include:

1. **Users Collection**
   ```javascript
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     email: String,
     password: String (hashed),
     role: String,
     status: String,
     createdAt: Date,
     updatedAt: Date
   }
   ```
   This collection stores essential user information with proper indexing on email and role fields for efficient querying.

2. **Profiles Collection**
   ```javascript
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     userId: ObjectId,
     firstName: String,
     lastName: String,
     phone: String,
     address: {
       street: String,
       city: String,
       state: String,
       country: String,
       zipCode: String
     },
     skills: [{
       name: String,
       level: String,
       yearsOfExperience: Number
     }],
     experience: [{
       company: String,
       position: String,
       startDate: Date,
       endDate: Date,
       description: String
     }],
     education: [{
       institution: String,
       degree: String,
       field: String,
       graduationYear: Number
     }]
   }
   ```

3. **Jobs Collection**
   ```javascript
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     employerId: ObjectId,
     title: String,
     description: String,
     requirements: [String],
     location: {
       type: String,
       coordinates: [Number, Number]
     },
     salary: {
       min: Number,
       max: Number,
       currency: String
     },
     type: String,
     status: String,
     postedAt: Date,
     expiresAt: Date
   }
   ```

4. **Applications Collection**
   ```javascript
   {
     _id: ObjectId,
     jobId: ObjectId,
     userId: ObjectId,
     status: String,
     resume: String,
     coverLetter: String,
     appliedAt: Date,
     updatedAt: Date
   }
   ```

#### 5.1.2 Database Indexing Strategy

To optimize query performance, strategic indexes have been implemented:

1. **Primary Indexes**
   - `_id` field (automatically indexed by MongoDB)
   - Compound indexes for frequently queried fields

2. **Secondary Indexes**
   - Email field for user authentication
   - Job title and location for search optimization
   - Status fields for filtering
   - Date fields for sorting and time-based queries

3. **Text Indexes**
   - Job descriptions and requirements for full-text search
   - Profile skills and experience for candidate matching

#### 5.1.3 Data Relationships

The database implements relationships through references and embedded documents:

1. **One-to-One Relationships**
   - User to Profile (referenced)
   - Company to Employer Profile (embedded)

2. **One-to-Many Relationships**
   - Employer to Jobs (referenced)
   - Job to Applications (referenced)
   - User to Applications (referenced)

3. **Many-to-Many Relationships**
   - Skills to Jobs (through arrays)
   - Users to Saved Jobs (through arrays)

### 5.2 Server-Side Architecture

The server-side architecture of FutureLift Job Portal is built using Node.js and Express.js, following a modular and scalable design pattern. The architecture is organized into distinct layers, each with specific responsibilities.

   const router = express.Router();
   const jobController = require('../controllers/jobController');
   const auth = require('../middleware/auth');

   router.get('/', jobController.getAllJobs);
   router.post('/', auth, jobController.createJob);
   router.get('/:id', jobController.getJobById);
   router.put('/:id', auth, jobController.updateJob);
   router.delete('/:id', auth, jobController.deleteJob);
   ```

2. **Response Formatting**
   ```javascript
   const successResponse = (res, data, message = 'Success') => {
     return res.status(200).json({
       success: true,
       message,
       data
     });
   };

   const errorResponse = (res, error, status = 500) => {
     return res.status(status).json({
       success: false,
       message: error.message
     });
   };
   ```

### 5.4 Authentication and Authorization

The authentication and authorization system is implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) with additional security measures.

#### 5.4.1 Authentication Implementation

1. **JWT Configuration**
   ```javascript
   const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
   const config = require('../config/auth');

   const generateToken = (user) => {
     return jwt.sign(
       { id: user._id, role: user.role },
       config.jwtSecret,
       { expiresIn: '24h' }
     );
   };
   ```

2. **Password Security**
   ```javascript
   const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');

   const hashPassword = async (password) => {
     const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
     return bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
   };

   const comparePassword = async (password, hashedPassword) => {
     return bcrypt.compare(password, hashedPassword);
   };
   ```

#### 5.4.2 Authorization Implementation

1. **Role-Based Access Control**
   ```javascript
   const authorize = (...roles) => {
     return (req, res, next) => {
       if (!roles.includes(req.user.role)) {
         return res.status(403).json({
           success: false,
           message: 'Unauthorized access'
         });
       }
       next();
     };
   };
   ```

2. **Resource Ownership**
   ```javascript
   const checkOwnership = (model) => {
     return async (req, res, next) => {
       const resource = await model.findById(req.params.id);
       if (!resource) {
         return res.status(404).json({
           success: false,
           message: 'Resource not found'
         });
       }
       if (resource.userId.toString() !== req.user.id) {
         return res.status(403).json({
           success: false,
           message: 'Unauthorized access'
         });
       }
       next();
     };
   };
   ```

#### 5.4.3 Security Measures

1. **Rate Limiting**
   ```javascript
   const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

   const authLimiter = rateLimit({
     windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
     max: 5,
     message: 'Too many login attempts, please try again later'
   });
   ```

2. **Input Validation**
   ```javascript
   const { body, validationResult } = require('express-validator');

   const validateJob = [
     body('title').trim().notEmpty().withMessage('Title is required'),
     body('description').trim().notEmpty().withMessage('Description is required'),
     body('requirements').isArray().withMessage('Requirements must be an array'),
     (req, res, next) => {
       const errors = validationResult(req);
       if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
         return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
       }
       next();
     }
   ];
   ```

This comprehensive back-end implementation ensures a secure, scalable, and maintainable system that effectively handles the complex requirements of the FutureLift Job Portal.
